CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATION FORMULAS
=====================================
Global Eco Footprint Atlas Calculator

OVERVIEW
--------
The calculator estimates annual carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions based on four main categories:
Transportation, Energy, Food, and Consumption habits.

DETAILED FORMULAS
=================

1. TRANSPORTATION (tons CO₂ per year)
-------------------------------------
Formula: Transportation = (Car km/week × 0.4) + (Flight hours/year × 0.9)

Components:
• Car emissions: 0.4 kg CO₂ per kilometer driven
• Flight emissions: 0.9 kg CO₂ per hour of flight time

Example:
- Car: 240 km/week → 240 × 0.4 = 96 kg CO₂/week = 4.99 tons/year
- Flights: 10 hours/year → 10 × 0.9 = 9 kg CO₂/year = 0.009 tons/year

2. ENERGY (tons CO₂ per year)
-----------------------------
Formula: Energy = Monthly electricity bill (₹) × 0.1

Components:
• Electricity factor: 0.1 kg CO₂ per rupee spent on electricity
• Accounts for grid energy mix and consumption patterns

Example:
- Monthly bill: ₹3,000 → 3000 × 0.1 = 300 kg CO₂/month = 3.6 tons/year

3. FOOD (tons CO₂ per year)
---------------------------
Formula: Fixed values based on diet type

Diet Categories:
• Meat-heavy diet: 2.5 tons CO₂/year
• Mixed/balanced diet: 1.8 tons CO₂/year
• Vegetarian diet: 1.2 tons CO₂/year

Basis: Lifecycle assessment studies of food production

4. CONSUMPTION (tons CO₂ per year)
----------------------------------
Formula: Fixed values based on shopping habits

Shopping Categories:
• High consumption: 1.5 tons CO₂/year
• Medium consumption: 1.0 tons CO₂/year
• Low consumption: 0.5 tons CO₂/year

Includes: Goods, electronics, clothing, and general purchases

5. TOTAL CARBON FOOTPRINT
--------------------------
Formula: Total = Transportation + Energy + Food + Consumption

Example Calculation:
- Transportation: 5.0 tons
- Energy: 3.6 tons
- Food: 1.8 tons
- Consumption: 1.0 tons
Total: 11.4 tons CO₂/year

6. CO₂ SAVINGS ESTIMATION
-------------------------
Formula: CO₂ Saved = Number of calculations × 2.3 kg

Represents potential CO₂ reduction through environmental awareness

CONVERSION FACTORS
==================
• 1 ton = 1,000 kg
• Weekly to annual: multiply by 52
• Monthly to annual: multiply by 12

DATA SOURCES & METHODOLOGY
===========================
• Transportation factors: Vehicle emission standards
• Energy factors: Grid carbon intensity data
• Food factors: Lifecycle assessment studies
• Consumption factors: Product carbon footprint research

LIMITATIONS
===========
• Simplified model for quick estimation
• Actual footprints vary by location, specific circumstances
• Regional variations in energy mix not accounted for
• Individual usage patterns may differ significantly

AVERAGE COMPARISONS
===================
• Global average: 4.8 tons CO₂/person/year
• India average: 1.9 tons CO₂/person/year
• USA average: 16.1 tons CO₂/person/year
• EU average: 8.2 tons CO₂/person/year

ACCURACY NOTES
==============
This calculator provides educational estimates to raise environmental awareness.
For precise measurements, professional carbon auditing is recommended.
