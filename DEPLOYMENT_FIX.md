# Deployment Health Check Fix Guide

## Identified Issues and Solutions

### 1. **PORT CONFIGURATION ISSUE (Primary Issue)**

**Problem**: The `.replit` file has multiple ports configured, which causes deployment failures according to Replit documentation.

**Current Configuration**:
```toml
[[ports]]
localPort = 5000
externalPort = 80

[[ports]]
localPort = 5001
externalPort = 3000
```

**Solution**: Only ONE port should be exposed for deployments. The extra port (5001/3000) should be removed.

**Action Required**: Contact Replit support to remove the second port configuration or modify the .replit file manually in the Replit interface.

### 2. **DEPLOYMENT COMMAND ISSUE**

**Problem**: The deployment configuration shows:
```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run build"]
```

This is INCORRECT. The deployment is trying to run the build command instead of starting the server.

**Correct Configuration Should Be**:
```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
build = ["sh", "-c", "npm run build"]
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm start"]
```

### 3. **ENHANCED HEALTH CHECK ENDPOINTS**

✅ **FIXED**: Added comprehensive health check endpoints that provide detailed information:

- `GET /health` - Main application health check
- `GET /api/health` - API-specific health check  
- `GET /ping` - Simple connectivity test
- `GET /api/ping` - API connectivity test

All endpoints return proper 200 status codes with JSON responses including:
- Status ("healthy")
- Timestamp
- Environment information
- Port information
- Application uptime

### 4. **SERVER CONFIGURATION**

✅ **VERIFIED**: Server is correctly configured for deployment:
- Binds to `0.0.0.0` (not localhost)
- Uses `PORT` environment variable (defaults to 5000)
- Properly handles both development and production modes

## Verification Tests

### Local Tests (All Passing ✅)
```bash
# Health check endpoints respond with 200 status
curl -I http://0.0.0.0:5000/health        # Returns 200 OK
curl -I http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/health    # Returns 200 OK

# JSON responses are properly formatted
curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","message":"Global Eco Footprint Atlas is running",...}

# Production build works
npm run build                              # ✅ Successful
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js     # ✅ Server starts correctly
```

### Production Tests (All Passing ✅)
- Build process generates optimized bundles
- Static files are served correctly from dist/public
- Health check endpoints respond correctly in production mode
- Server binds to correct port and host

## Required Actions to Fix Deployment

### Immediate Actions (Can Be Done Now)
1. ✅ **Enhanced health check endpoints** - COMPLETED
2. ✅ **Verified server configuration** - COMPLETED  
3. ✅ **Tested production build** - COMPLETED

### Actions Requiring Replit Interface Access
1. **Remove Extra Port Configuration**:
   - Access .replit file in Replit interface
   - Remove the second port block (localPort 5001, externalPort 3000)
   - Keep only the first port (localPort 5000, externalPort 80)

2. **Fix Deployment Command**:
   - Change deployment configuration from:
     ```toml
     run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run build"]
     ```
   - To:
     ```toml
     build = ["sh", "-c", "npm run build"]
     run = ["sh", "-c", "npm start"]
     ```

## Deployment Health Check Endpoints

The application now provides multiple endpoints for health checking:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `/health` | Main health check | JSON with status, uptime, environment |
| `/api/health` | API health check | JSON with API status information |
| `/ping` | Simple connectivity | "pong" text response |
| `/api/ping` | API connectivity | "pong" text response |

## Expected Results After Fix

✅ **Health Checks Should Pass**: All endpoints return 200 status codes
✅ **Deployment Should Start**: Server correctly starts with `npm start`
✅ **Single Port Exposure**: Only port 5000 exposed externally
✅ **Production Environment**: NODE_ENV properly set to production

## Troubleshooting

If health checks still fail after these fixes:

1. **Check deployment logs** for any error messages
2. **Verify PORT environment variable** is being set by the platform
3. **Test with simple curl commands** to each health endpoint
4. **Ensure no firewall issues** are blocking the health check requests

## Summary

The deployment health check failures are primarily caused by:
1. Multiple port configurations (violates Replit deployment requirements)
2. Incorrect deployment run command (tries to build instead of start)

The application code itself is correctly configured and all health check endpoints work properly. The fixes require accessing the .replit configuration file through the Replit interface.
