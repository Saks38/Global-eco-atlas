## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern React features
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing (configured but not yet implemented)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming and dark mode support
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Hookform resolvers for validation
- **Charts**: Chart.js for data visualization capabilities

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless provider
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries and schema management
- **Authentication**: Session-based with connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints with /api prefix
- **Validation**: Shared Zod schemas between frontend and backend

### Development Setup
- **Package Manager**: npm with ES modules
- **TypeScript**: Strict configuration across client, server, and shared code
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for frontend, tsx for backend development
- **Path Mapping**: Clean imports using @ aliases (@/, @shared/, @assets/)
- **Build Process**: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for backend production builds

## Key Components

### Database Schema (shared/schema.ts)
Comprehensive environmental tracking system:
- **Users**: User profiles with gamification (levels, experience points)
- **Footprint Calculations**: Detailed carbon footprint data with breakdown by category
- **Stories**: Environmental stories from different countries with engagement metrics
- **Achievements**: User achievement system for motivation and engagement
- **Environmental Data**: Real-world environmental statistics by country and year
- **Global Stats**: Aggregated environmental data for dashboard insights
- **Newsletter Subscriptions**: Email subscription management

The schema uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect and supports complex environmental data tracking.

### Storage Interface (server/storage.ts)
- **Abstraction Layer**: IStorage interface defines CRUD operations
- **In-Memory Implementation**: MemStorage class for development/testing
- **Database Ready**: Structured to easily swap to Drizzle database implementation

### Frontend Structure

### API Layer
- **Request Utilities**: Custom fetch wrapper with error handling and credentials
- **Query Functions**: Reusable query functions with unauthorized behavior options
- **Logging**: Request/response logging middleware for API endpoints

## Data Flow

### Frontend to Backend
1. Frontend makes API requests using custom fetch utilities
2. Requests include credentials for session management
3. TanStack Query handles caching and state management
4. Responses are validated and typed using shared schemas

### Database Operations
1. Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database queries
2. Migrations managed through drizzle-kit
3. Schema changes tracked in ./migrations directory
4. Connection pooling handled by Neon serverless

### Authentication Flow
1. Session-based authentication using PostgreSQL session store
2. Middleware handles session validation
3. Protected routes check authentication status
4. User context maintained across requests

## External Dependencies

### Database Provider
- **Neon**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Connection**: DATABASE_URL environment variable required
- **Features**: Automatic scaling, built-in connection pooling

### UI Components

- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Class Variance Authority**: Component variant management

### Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Cartographer plugin for development environment
- **Runtime Error Modal**: Development error overlay
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Tailwind and Autoprefixer

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds optimized production bundle to dist/public
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code to dist/index.js
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push` command
4. **Assets**: Static files served from dist/public

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: NODE_ENV=development with hot reload
- **Production**: NODE_ENV=production with optimized builds
- **Database**: DATABASE_URL must be provided for both environments

### Scripts
- **dev**: Development server with hot reload (NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts)
- **build**: Production build for both frontend and backend (vite build && esbuild server/index.ts)
- **start**: Production server startup (NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js)
- **check**: TypeScript type checking
- **db:push**: Apply database schema changes

### Health Check Endpoints
- **GET /health**: Main health check endpoint returning 200 status with application status
- **GET /api/health**: API-specific health check endpoint for monitoring API functionality
- Both endpoints return JSON with status, message, timestamp, and environment information

### Production Deployment
The application is fully configured for production deployment:
- Server binds to 0.0.0.0:5000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- Static files served from dist/public directory
- Health check endpoints respond with proper 200 status codes
- Build process creates optimized bundles for both frontend and backend
- Compatible with cloud platforms including Replit Deployments

The application requires minimal configuration and can be deployed to any cloud platform supporting Node.js applications.
